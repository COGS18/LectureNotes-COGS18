    "# Final Project (19% of final grade)\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of completing COGS 18, you must complete an independent project (_or_ take the final exam).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the assignments, you may discuss the final project with your classmates, and that is one advantage of project over the final exam in which you may not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects are still turned in individually. If you work on a shared part of the project with another student(s), that is okay _but_ that portion must be marked as such and is excluded from grading (details below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The broad objectives of this project are for you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a topic that you are interested and work on code related to that idea\n",
    "- Be able to plan out what is required for a computational solution to your chosen topic - design and write an implementation of your project plan in Python code\n",
    "- Practice following best practices for coding style, documentation and code testing\n",
    "- Work with different coding tools, including using Jupyter notebooks and Python files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "- W8: Project Description released\n",
    "- W9: By the end of this week, you should have a project topic / outline\n",
    "- W10: Work on the project\n",
    "- **Finals Week: projects due Tuesday 12/12 before 11:59pm**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly encourage you to discuss potential project ideas and with your TAs/IAs/instructor through office hours and coding labs (or on Piazza). This will give us a chance to give you feedback and help guide your project plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions for working on projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work consistently\n",
    "  - Slow and steady is a much friendlier way to develop code than a last minute sprint\n",
    "If you get stuck, pause, and ask for help\n",
    "  - Seek advice when you are unsure, and seek it early and often\n",
    "- Talk to course staff and each other about projects \n",
    "  - Ask questions on Piazza\n",
    "  - Ask questions to course staff\n",
    "  - Visit office hours\n",
    "  - Talk to other students about projects, and help each other\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Project Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "For your project, you can choose a topic that extends an application from one of the assignments, or propose your own topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encryption (A2)\n",
    "- Chatbots (A3)\n",
    "- Artificial Agents (A4)\n",
    "- Data Analysis (A5)\n",
    "- Choose your own adventure (propose and develop your own project idea)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more detailed project ideas in [this `ProjectIdeas` notebook](https://github.com/COGS18/Projects/blob/master/ProjectIdeas.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of strong projects in the past [are here](https://github.com/COGS18/Projects#projects).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Taboo Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "While you're allowed to work on a topic of your choosing there are a few \"taboo topics\" - or topics that are not permitted for the COGS 18 final project. These topics are off the table for two reasons: (1) There are a lot of examples of these out on the Internet. While you're allowed to borrow code from elsewhere, we want to ensure that you get the chance to implement code on your own and aren't limited by what others have done and (2) It gets boring to grade these when we get a whole bunch of them that all look super similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taboo Topics for the COGS18 final project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hangman\n",
    "- Drawings from Turtle\n",
    "- Tic-tac-toe\n",
    "- Blackjack\n",
    "- Magic 8 Ball\n",
    "- Rock, Paper, Scissors\n",
    "- Snake Game\n",
    "- Connect4 Game \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you have a great or interesting idea that puts a new spin on a a taboo topic, reach out to your Professor and ask for an exception. You'll have to explain your idea. And, if approved, you'll be able to work on your taboo topic of choice!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of the project is to demonstrate that you can design and implement code to fulfill some task that you choose. That is, the goal of the project is to plan and write some code that solves a novel problem, one for which the solution is not pre-specified (as compared to and different from the assignments).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not a specific amount of code that you have to write for the project. In terms of project scope, your project must implement some new thing, that you design and write the code for. To do so, you are expected to write new code that creates or adds some functionality, and that does so using good code practices. As a rule of thumb, note a good project will have at least a set of new functions, will use code constructs such as loops and conditionals, will import code from available modules when needed, and will do all of this organized into a well constructed organization, in which the code follows proper coding style, is documented, and includes at least three code tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the focus of the project is working with Python code, there is **no** prioritization for trying to perform complex tasks. On the contrary, in the face of a complex task in which the work ends up being trying to understand the complex topic you are working on, instead of focusing on working directly with Python code, a simpler project topic is preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through your project, we recommend taking an approach in which you use a modular design and **prioritize creating a minimal viable product**, using a rapid prototyping approach. That is, try things out quickly. Write some code, check if it works, figure out why or why not, and iterate onto a next version. If you code for more than an hour without your code running successfully, you are probably writing too much at once. Write code in small chunks, testing often as you write. Aim to get just the core of the project working first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get the core of the project working, you can add any extra pieces that would be nice and useful to extend the scope of the project, knowing that you have the core idea working.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your project must include (at least) one Jupyter notebook, one Python file (a module file), and one test file.** The Jupyter notebook file will minimally include a description of the project and code that demonstrates your project, organized in cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the actual code for the project will be organized into Python files, as either module files and/or scripts. Exactly where and how you organize the code can and should be decided by the project topic itself. For example, projects that are more focused on functions and classes, all code may be organized into a module. For some projects, the code may be well organized into a script that imports from your module to execute your project. For other projects, with more interactive components, much of the code may be presented within the Jupyter notebook. Regardless of the project, the design should be modular and include original code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects are individual, and each person needs to submit a project including (at least some) unique and original code. Projects can also include code that comes directly from the assignments, and/or from working with other students on project ideas, but this should be clearly marked and attributed in your submissions. More details on external code are included below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be submitting either 1) the project folder on datahub (note all contents of the folder will be submitted when you click submit on datahub) or 2) a zip file containing your project to Canvas. This submitted folder must be structured in some organized manner. We provide the following as a suggestion, but you can use a different file structure if necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "MyProjectFolder/  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - ProjectNotebook.ipynb\n",
    "  - my_module/\n",
    "    - classes.py\n",
    "    - functions.py\n",
    "    - test_functions.py\n",
    "  - scripts/\n",
    "    - my_script.py \n",
    "  - requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that not all of these files and sections are mandatory, and they do not have to use the names specified here—file names can be whatever you want, as long as the organization is clear and what kind of thing each file is is clear. **You must include, at minimum, a Jupyter notebook, and some part of your code should be organized into a module, with a test file**. The scripts section is optional, and should be included if it makes sense to organize your functionality into an executable script. The requirements text file (optional) should list any modules you use in your project that are not included on Datahub (i.e. you had to run `pip install` to get them).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *How to create a zip file*\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make sure everything is organized into a folder, as you want it. Then: \n",
    "\n",
    "- On Mac: right-click on the folder, and click 'Compress'.\n",
    "- On Windows: right-click on the folder, go to 'Send To' and select 'Compressed (zipped) folder'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, this will create a zip file, with the name 'FolderName.zip'. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can upload this file to Canvas as your project submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Rubric\n",

    "*Extra Credit (_up to_ 4%)*\n",
    "\n",
    "For extra credit, if you go above and beyond on the minimal project requirements and challenge yourself to approach a project that is more complex than the basic requirements, requires you to learn something beyond what was taught in the course, or uses code concepts not taught in class, explain this at the end of your Jupyter notebook.

    "### External Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project may include external code - that can be code from the course (assignments, materials, and/or coding labs), code from fellow students, that you perhaps worked on together, and/or code from other sources. Note that this code is not considered original code for the project, and will not be graded. Please follow the following guidelines when doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Course Code\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome and even expected to take code from the course, in particular code from the assignments. This does not need to be cited, but it also will not count as original/unique code you've written. Note that superficial code changes (i.e. simply changing variable/function names) does NOT count as making code unique/original.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Code co-developed with other student(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work with other students on aspects of the project if you are working on similar topics. For any code that was developed together, you can include this code in your project, and indicate that it was written together with another student. Note that each student will be graded primarily on the unique code that is submitted as part of their project—because this is not, ultimately, a group project.\n",

    "##### Provide Attribution!\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear attribution of code is important. Failing to indicate which code you did not write and passing it off as your own is (and will be considered) plagiarism. To cite code, indicate in the docstring for the module/function/class or code segment that this code is external code, and include the source of the code. For example:\n",

    "##### Modified Code\n",
    "\n",
    "It may also be the case that you originally start with code from an external source, but you modify that code - perhaps refactoring it, reorganizing the code, and/ or editing and updating the code organization and functionality. If this is the case, still provide attribution and a link to source. And if you significantly update the code organization and/or functionality (refactoring the code, and/or updating functionality more than just updating naming, style and documentation), then you can and should indicate that this adapted code is to be considered part of your graded project code.

    "# Project FAQ\n",
    "This FAQ is meant to answer a number of commonly-asked questions about the COGS 18 final project. We hope you find it helpful as you develop your awesome projects!\n",
    "## File Structure and Requirements \n",
    "#### Do we still need a .py file if all our code and functions are in a Jupyter notebook?\n",
    "Yes, you need at least one .py file - a module that stores your code. If all of your code is in your notebook, it's time to reorganize.\n",
    "#### What is the difference between a script and a module?\n",
    "A module stores functions/classes that you'll want to use later, perhaps in your script or notebook. Scripts include code intended to run from top to bottom and will likely use the functions in your module.\n",
    "#### How do I create a script or module?\n",
    "On Datahub or Anaconda, in the new tab at the top right, select text file. When you save that file, save it with a .py extension. Alternatively, from the terminal, you can use the `touch` command.\n",
    "#### What goes in requirements.txt?\n",
    "You should mention if you installed any new packages via pip for your project that aren’t included by default in the anaconda distribution/datahub so we'll be able to run your code properly. If you didn't install anything to run your code, you don't need to include this file.\n",
    "#### How do I install a library?\n",
    "Use pip in the terminal. On datahub, the command will look something like: `pip install --user package`.\n",
    "#### Is there a set number of functions or classes we need to include?\n",
    "You need at least 3 original functions or methods. There is no class requirement. (For example, you could have a single class with 3 methods. Or, no classes and 3 separate functions.)\n",
    "#### Can I write my entire project code into one class?\n",
    "Yes, as long as the class includes a modular design where there are multiple independent methods.\n",
    "#### Are we supposed to call our files and directories functions.py, ProjectNotebook.ipynb, etc. or should we call them something related to the project itself?\n",
    "You could change the names if you'd like or keep them as they are. Just make sure to import using the correct file names.\n",
    "#### Can I submit the project using a different file structure than the template provided?\n",
    "Yes, the specific file structure is not important. We care that you have a folder that contains a notebook and a script/module file (or both). Other files can also be included if applicable. Use an oganization structure that makes sense for your project.\n",
    "#### How/in what format should the files be submitted?\n",
    "For submitting your final projects, you will either 1) zip up all the files for your project (i.e. Notebook + module directory with tests and functions) and submit the zipped file on Canvas or 2) submit on datahub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I wrote a function in a file, and I am trying to use it a separate file; however, it says that my function \"is not defined\".\n",
    "Check to make sure you imported your function before trying to call it. You will need to import any functions you write if you want to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I am trying to import specific functions from my module, but it says that my module does not exist?\n",
    "Check the location of the file that contains your functions. If your my_functions.py file is within a folder (let's say called `modules/`), you would need to call `from modules.my_functions import func1, func2` instead of just   `import my_functions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "More resources for importing modules:\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Citations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If I went back through my class notes because I couldn't remember how do X, and I found an example of how in the notes, would this require a citation?\n",
    "No. This would not require a citation if you're referencing something taught in class; however, if you copy and paste a function used in an Assignment or lecture directly for your project, this would require citation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I looked up how to do X and found a thread about it on a website that helped me figure out my problem. I cited this in my Jupyter notebook, is that necessary?\n",
    "This is fine and good practice. Including a comment (`#`) with the URL is sufficient for this project. Specify whether you've modified code (changed it) or used it directly - either is fine, but best to be clear about this. You can also mention the sources in the docstring of a function if a major part of that function code was referenced from an external source.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is it okay to use the code from Assignment X as long as I make some modifications? Will I be marked down for not coming up with it on my own?\n",
    "This is fine as long as you cite your sources with a comment and write at least 3 original functions/methods that are not from the Assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation and Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where should I include docstrings and comments?\n",
    "Your module with your functions should have docstrings for functions and inline comments as needed. The Notebook would likely then (depending on your project) have a description of your project in a markdown cell, import your functions, and then run your main function to demonstrate how your project works. If you choose to run your project using a script rather than a Notebook, the Notebook should contain a short description of the project and a line of code that runs your script, such as `%run -i 'script.py'` or `!python script.py`. Note that test functions don’t require docstrings, but including them is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Do we need a docstring for `__init__` functions of classes?\n",
    "Depends on how complicated your `__init__` function is. Can the reader tell at a glance what the init function is doing or which class variables are being set and why? If not, maybe describe those variables in code documentation and have a simple method comment that says \"Class constructor for class Foo.\" When in doubt, make comments!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For a class docstring, there is a methods section to list the methods of the class. Is it necessary to have a short description of those methods again in the class docstring since there are methods docstrings?\n",
    "No need to describe the methods; just describe what the class is used for briefly. Repetitions can be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "More resources for formatting docstrings:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How many tests are needed? Do we need tests for only one function or for all of them in the project?\n",
    "You need to test at least three methods/functions, using at least three test functions. These tests should be for your original code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I used a function from Assignment X, and I was wondering if I could make a test for that one rather than a function I wrote.\n",
    "You may also (and are encouraged to) write test these functions as well; however, your three required tests must test your original code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Do we need to import our test functions into our script/Notebook?\n",
    "You can leave them in the test file; however, it's recommended that you use `pytest` to ensure all your tests pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do I run pytest?\n",
    "If you open up a terminal and navigate to the directory where your test functions are, you can run the following: `pytest name_of_file_with_test_functions.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How would I test a function that needs user input?\n",
    "The simplest way is to move the user input outside of the function and give it as a parameter to the function. Otherwise, we recommend checking out this link: \n",

    "## DataHub Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### My cells won't run properly and keep giving me asterisks even after restarting the kernel. How can I fix this?\n",
    "Asterisks mean that the code in a cell is executing/waiting to execute. You may be stuck in an infinite loop somewhere in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DataHub won't open my Notebook/script/module. What should I do?\n",
    "Download the the Notebook/script/module from datahub to your machine using the steps below. It's always a good idea to maintain a local copy of your work in case DataHub is ever down.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do we download files from DataHub onto our desktop?\n",
    "There are two general approaches (with option 1 being the simpler one):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on boxes to the left of file names on Jupyter, download the files one-by-one, then recreate the file structure (meaning put files in the correct directories) on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the command line on datahub to zip files up (if you're comfortable with how to do this), and download the zipped file to desktop to submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where is the project submitted?\n",
    "Canvas or Datahub.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How many times can I submit the project?\n",
    "You can submit as many times as you'd like, but the most recent submission is what we'll grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How extensive or complex does our code need to be to get a good grade?\n",
    "We don't care so much about how difficult/complex your code is as we do care to see that you can implement the concepts taught throughout this course with code you've written yourself. These functions should demonstrate concepts and material we've covered throughout the class (conditionals, operators, loops, etc). Additionally, your code should be documented and commented throughout, including code tests and well-formatted code with good names. This means you may have to modify code provided to you to improve it.... or at the very least you'll have to document and comment it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Do we have to be present on the day that our final is scheduled?\n",
    "No, all you need to do is make sure to turn in your final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do I specify extra credit?\n",
    "There is an extra credit opportunity on the final project. If you go above and beyond the requirements of the project and/or teach yourself something new in the process of completing the final project, explain this in the final cell of the Jupyter Notebook you turn in. This should include 1) your background in programming prior to this course and 2) a description of how you went above and beyond and/or what you learned in the process of completing the project.\n",
